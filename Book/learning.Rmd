## Basics

```{r}
library(Epi)
data(births)
stat.table
stat.table(sex, mean(bweight), data=births)
```
## Measures of disease occurrence

### Prevenlence

```{r}
# prevalence = The prevalence of a disease in a population is the fraction of the population that has the disease at a given date

(16281/5534738) * 100 #empirical prevalence

# theoretical prevalence
#theoretical prevalence is the probability that a randomly chosen person from the
#population has colorectal cancer
library( Epi )
N <- 5534738
X <- 16281
mp <- glm( cbind( X, N-X ) ~ 1, family=binomial )
round( ci.pred( mp ) * 100, 4 )

```
### Mortality rate

```{r}
#Mortality is typically reported as a number of people that have died in a population #of a certain size

##Empirical mortality rate
(2648 / 150000)*1000
#This is a mortality of 17.6 per 1,000 without time correction
(2648 / (150000*2))*1000 # Mortality rate adjusted by two years

## Theoretical mortality rate
# It is the probability of dying in a small interval, relative to the length of the interval

library( Epi )
D <- 2648
Y <- 300000 #The double because 2 years
mm <- glm( D ~ 1, offset=log(Y), family=poisson )
round( ci.pred( mm, newdata=data.frame(Y=1000) ), 3 )
